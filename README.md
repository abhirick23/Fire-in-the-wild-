# Fire-in-the-wild-

A wildfire (AKA forest or peat fire) is an uncontrolled fire. Wildfires often occur in (duh) wild, unpopulated areas, but they can occur anywhere and harm homes, agriculture, humans, and animals in their path.
Firefighters also refer to these disasters as surface fires, dependent crown fires, spot fires, and ground fires.

Wildfires can burn millions of acres of land at shockingly fast speeds, consuming everything in their paths. These rolling flames travel up to 14 miles an hour, which converts to about a four-minute-mile pace, and can overtake the average human in minutes

Weather conditions can directly contribute to the occurrence of wildfires through lightning strikes or indirectly by an extended dry spell or drought.
Wildfires can be caused by an accumulation of dead matter (leaves, twigs, and trees) that can create enough heat in some instances to spontaneously combust and ignite the surrounding area.
Lightning strikes the earth over 100,000 times a day. 10 to 20% of these lightning strikes can cause fire.
Manmade combustions from arson, human carelessness, or lack of fire safety cause wildfire disasters every year.

Water is the most obvious, efficient, and universal fire extinguisher, but large-scale use of water in fire fighting is limited because it is usually in short supply and application methods are not adequate. For these reasons other materials have been tested for persistence and efficiency in putting out fires. Wetting agents change the physical characteristics of water to increase its penetrating and spreading abilities.
Retardants, such as sodium calcium borate, reduce the flammability of wood and therefore its rate of burning. Foaming agents in powder or liquid form can greatly increase the mixture volume and thereby cool, moisten, and insulate the fuel.

This projects help to identify whether there is a fire or not so that quick solutions can be made.
